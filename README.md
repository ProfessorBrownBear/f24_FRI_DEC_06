### This is to demonstrate the process of git pull and git push
#### where we are going with this:

A. make some files here
B. cmd line: gh login auth <PAT>
C. gh clone cloud repo to local (get the clone URL from GH cloud)
D. setup gh client in a local directory : make local premises clone of Cloud Repo
E. change some files in Local repository (directory)
F. git push : observe the change is available in GH cloud repo
G. change files in Cloud -> git sync or git pull / observe changes available locally
H.Next : step up GIT Action by making a yml file locally -> git push
I DO a git commit to local repo / git sync / For A4 -> screen shots of your Git Actions Panel
